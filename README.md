Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Petoi Bittle Robot
- Raspberry pi (Zero 2, 4 or 5)
- ROS2 (Tested on Humble)
- Python 3.5 or higher
- Git
- Docker (On raspberry pi)

## Desktop/Laptop setup
#### Install ros2 humble from instructions here:: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html
#### build workspace
```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
```
#### clone the bittle_ros2 package
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gravesreid/bittle_ros2.git
```
#### clone bittle_msgs package
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gravesreid/bittle_msgs.git
```
#### Clone joy package
```bash
git clone --branch ros2 https://github.com/ros-drivers/joystick_drivers.git
```
#### Install colcon
```bash
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
```
#### make sure dependencies are updated and installed
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src -r -y
```
#### build the package
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
```

#### Source the environment
```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

## Raspberry pi setup
#### Configure raspberry pi as detailed here in the readme: https://github.com/gravesreid/autonomous-bittle.git

### install ros2 using docker taken from:
https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/How-To-Guides/Installing-on-Raspberry-Pi.html

#### Steps to install:
```bash
 curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
 sudo sh get-docker.sh
```
#### so you don't need to use sudo
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
```bash
newgrp docker
```
Check that docker works
```bash
docker run hello-world
```

#### You can download the latest docker image with the setup steps already completed here:
```bash
docker pull gravesreid/bittle_ros_humble:latest
```

### Set up Workspace on Raspberry Pi
#### get docker image id
```bash
docker images
```
#### launch docker container
```bash
docker run -it --net=host --privileged [image_id]
```
#### source ros2
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```
#### source your workspace
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
source install/setup.bash
```
### if you didn't pull the bittle_ros_humble docker image, this is what you need to do to set up your desktop ros2 workspace also
#### make ros2 workspace
```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
```
#### clone the bittle_ros2 package
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gravesreid/bittle_ros2.git
```
#### clone bittle_msgs package
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gravesreid/bittle_msgs.git
```
#### Clone joy package
```bash
git clone --branch ros2 https://github.com/ros-drivers/joystick_drivers.git
```
#### Install colcon
```bash
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
```
#### make sure dependencies are updated and installed
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src -r -y
```
#### build the package
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
```

#### Source the environment
```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

### set up raspberry pi camera library instructions
from: https://medium.com/swlh/raspberry-pi-ros-2-camera-eef8f8b94304
1) clone packages
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src
   ```
   ```bash
   git clone --branch humble https://gitlab.com/boldhearts/ros2_v4l2_camera.git
   ```
   ```bash
   git clone --branch humble https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv.git
   ```
   ```bash
   git clone --branch humble https://github.com/ros-perception/image_common.git
   ```
   ```bash
   git clone --branch humble https://github.com/ros-perception/image_transport_plugins.git
   ```
2) install dependencies
   ```bash
   cd ..
   rosdep install --from-paths src -r -y
   ```
3) Build packages
   ```bash
   colcon build --packages-up-to v4l2_camera image_transport_plugins
   ```
4) Source workspace
   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```
### If using realsense camera: set up intel realsense D405 camera wrapper
1) install package
```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-librealsense2*
```
2) source workspace
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
source install/setup.bash
```


### Run Bittle controller with USB gamepad control

#### You may need to do some remapping of buttons. To determine your button mapping, plug your controller into your PC and run:
```bash
ros2 run joy joy_node
```

#### In another terminal:
```bash
ros2 topic echo /joy
```

#### If the mapping isn't correct, match up the dictionary and controller outputs in joystick_driver.py

#### Now you are ready to launch the controllers. On Bittle raspberry pi:
```bash
ros2 launch bittle_ros2 robot_joystic_launch.py
```

#### on your PC:
```bash
ros2 launch bittle_ros2 server_joystick_launch.py
```


### Run bittle controller after you have configured both the Raspberry Pi and Desktop for ROS2
1) make sure you source your build
```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```
2) make sure your domain is set
```bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=1
```

3) launch the server node
```bash
ros2 launch bittle_ros2 bittle_teleop_server_launch.py
```
An rqt GUI should open up on your desktop

4) source the build on the pi
```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

5) make sure your domain is set
```bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=1
```

6) launch the robot node
```bash
ros2 launch bittle_ros2 bittle_teleop_robot_launch.py
```

### run usb camera node after initial setup
To list which port the camera is attached to:
```bash
v4l2-ctl --list-devices
```
```bash
ros2 run usb_cam usb_cam_node_exe --ros-args --params-file src/usb_cam/config/params.yaml
```

### run raspberry pi camera node after initial setup
1) Source build
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   source install/setup.bash
   ```
2) Make sure domain is set (on pc and pi-same domain id for both)
```bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=1
```
3) run camera node on pi
```bash
ros2 run v4l2_camera v4l2_camera_node
```

4) run visualization tool on desktop/pc
```bash
ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
```
5) select image view in GUI that pops up. Choose /image_raw/compressed topic for low latency streaming. Make sure you have compressed image transport on your desktop:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-compressed-image-transport
```
